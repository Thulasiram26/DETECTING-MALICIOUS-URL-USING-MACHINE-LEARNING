# 🛡️ Detecting Malicious URLs using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Malicious URL detection is critical for safeguarding online browsing and preventing cyber threats like phishing and malware distribution.

This project implements a system for classifying URLs as benign or malicious using deep learning techniques. We focus on leveraging the advanced contextual understanding of Transformer models while tackling the key challenge of deploying them in a real-time, computationally constrained environment.

## 💡 The Scalability Challenge (Addressing BERT's Limitations)

**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** is highly proficient at analyzing complex language patterns in URLs, leading to high detection accuracy. However, its large size and high computational demands make it unsuitable for easy scalability to real-time detection systems.

To address this, this project explores and implements one or more of the following approaches to optimize the model for speed:

* **Model Distillation:** Utilizing a lighter, faster model like **DistilBERT** to retain high accuracy with reduced computational cost.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extracting a core set of **lexical features** (URL length, character entropy, keyword presence) to train a highly efficient, non-Transformer model (e.g., LightGBM or Random Forest) for rapid pre-filtering.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python **3.8** or higher
* **pip** (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Thulasiram26/DETECTING-MALICIOUS-URL-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING](https://github.com/Thulasiram26/DETECTING-MALICIOUS-URL-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING)
    cd DETECTING-MALICIOUS-URL-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you create a `requirements.txt` file listing libraries like `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, etc.)*

3.  **Download Pre-trained Model:**
    *(If applicable, specify where the trained model weights/checkpoint should be downloaded from or if they are included in the repo.)*

## 🚀 Usage

### To Run the Real-Time Classifier:

Use the main script to test the model on a single URL or a list of URLs.

```bash
python predict.py --url "[http://example.com/check_this_link](http://example.com/check_this_link)"

URL: [http://example.com/check_this_link](http://example.com/check_this_link)  -> Classification: Benign
URL: [http://malicious-login.xyz/portal](http://malicious-login.xyz/portal)  -> Classification: Malicious (Phishing)
